  This document presents a number of hints about how to set up your
  *Science* paper in \LaTeX.  We provide a template file, `scifile.tex`, 
  that you can use to set up the \LaTeX\ source for your article.  
  An example of the style is the special `{sciabstract}` environment
  used to set up the abstract you see here.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

*Science*'s publication workflow relies on Microsoft Word. To translate
\LaTeX\ files into Word, they use an intermediate MS-DOS routine [@tth] that
converts the TeX source into HTML. The routine is generally robust, but
it works best if the source document is clean \LaTeX\ without a
significant freight of local macros or `.sty` files. Use of the source
file `scifile.tex` as a template, and calling *only* the `.sty` and
`.bst` files specifically mentioned here, will generate a manuscript
that should be eminently reviewable, and yet will allow your paper to
proceed quickly into our production flow upon acceptance [@use2e].

# Formatting Citations {#sec-format}

You should be able to use normal Quarto citations. 
However, for final submission, you may need to make edits in accordance with
*Science* guidelens.

Please separate multiple citations within a single `\cite` command
using commas only; there should be *no space* between reference
keynames. That is, if you are citing two papers whose bibliography
keys are `keyname1` and `keyname2`, the in-text cite should read
`@keyname1,@keyname2`, *not* `[@keyname1; @keyname2]`.

Failure to follow these guidelines could lead to the omission of the
references in an accepted paper when the source file is translated to
Word via HTML.

# Handling Math, Tables, and Figures {#sec-handling}

Following are a few things to keep in mind in coding equations, tables,
and figures for submission to *Science*.

#### In-line math. {#sec-math}

The utility that we use for converting from LaTeX to HTML handles
in-line math relatively well. It is best to avoid using built-up
fractions in in-line equations, and going for the more boring "slash"
presentation whenever possible --- that is, for `$a/b$` (which comes out
as $a/b$) rather than `$\frac{a}{b}$` (which compiles as $\frac{a}{b}$).
Please do not code arrays or matrices as in-line math; display them
instead. And please keep your coding as TeX-y as possible --- avoid
using specialized math macro packages like `amstex.sty`.

#### Tables. {#sec-tables}

The HTML converter that we use seems to handle reasonably well simple
tables generated using the LaTeX `{tabular}` environment. For very
complicated tables, you may want to consider generating them in a word
processing program and including them as a separate file.

#### Figures. {#sec-figures}

Figure callouts within the text should not be in the form of
LaTeX references, but should simply be typed in --- that is, `(Fig. 1)`
rather than `\ref{fig1}`. For the figures themselves, treatment can
differ depending on whether the manuscript is an initial submission or a
final revision for acceptance and publication. For an initial submission
and review copy, you can use the LaTeX `{figure}` environment and the
`\includegraphics` command to include your PostScript figures at the end
of the compiled file. For the final revision, however, the `{figure}`
environment should *not* be used; instead, the figure captions
themselves should be typed in as regular text at the end of the source
file (an example is included here), and the figures should be uploaded
separately according to the Art Department's instructions.

# What to Send In {#sec-submit}

What you should send to *Science* will depend on the stage your
manuscript is in:

-   **Important:** If you're sending in the initial submission of your
    manuscript (that is, the copy for evaluation and peer review),
    please send in *only* a PDF version of the compiled file (including
    figures). Please do not send in the TeX source, `.sty`, `.bbl`, or
    other associated files with your initial submission. (For more
    information, please see the instructions at our Web submission
    site.)

-   When the time comes for you to send in your revised final manuscript
    (i.e., after peer review), we require that you include source files
    and generated files in your upload. **The .tex file should include
    the reference list as an itemized list (see \"Formatting citations\"
    for the various options). The bibliography should not be in a
    separate file.** Thus, if the name of your main source document is
    `ltxfile.tex`, you need to include:

    -   `ltxfile.tex`.

    -   `ltxfile.aux`, the auxilliary file generated by the compilation.

    -   A PDF file generated from `ltxfile.tex`.
