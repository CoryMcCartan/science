  This document presents a number of hints about how to set up your
  *Science* paper in \LaTeX.  We provide a template file, `scifile.tex`, 
  that you can use to set up the \LaTeX{} source for your article.  
  An example of the style is the special `{sciabstract}` environment
  used to set up the abstract you see here.
